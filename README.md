# react-i18next

## Getting started

The resources are imported into i18n.js like this.

```
import i18n from "i18next";
import LanguageDetector from "i18next-browser-languagedetector";
import { initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";
```

i18n needs some presets and initialises it with user defined translations.
```
i18n
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({})
```
Note: You can support a lanuguage dropdown menu by adding your own custom click event handlers.
